# About
Logisim component library for the computer architecture class at the
Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen.
The library contains components (ALU, register bank, program ROM, RAM,
PLA) to facilitate the development of a MIPS microarchitecture similar
to that from "Computer Organization and Design - The Hardware/Software
Interface, 4th ed." by David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy.

Don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions about using this
library for a course on computer architecture.


# How-to
Create the library in two steps (or just use the makefile):
  1. Add the Logisim source to the classpath of the Java project.
  2. Build a JAR file containing MANIFEST.MF as manifest file.
Then load the JAR file from Logisim and voilà!
